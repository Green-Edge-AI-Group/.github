## About Us
Green Edge AI Group  is an energetic research group. Our interests converge on green computing, energy-efficient machine learning, and machine unlearning, with the central goal of designing algorithms and systems that are simultaneously accurate, low-carbon, and privacy-respecting. These themes form the kernel of our long-term mission: making AI environmentally sustainable and ethically reversible.

As AI services migrate from cloud giants to edge devices and renewable-energy micro-data-centers, minimizing their lifetime carbon footprint becomes as critical as maximizing accuracy. Meanwhile, the right-to-be-forgotten regulations and user privacy expectations demand that models can efficiently “unlearn” sensitive data without full retraining. More broadly, our work on green, efficient, and reversible AI is poised to reshape learning theories (e.g., energy-aware generalization bounds) and unlock new applications in battery-powered IoT, carbon-neutral datacenters, automated compression, federated unlearning, and sustainable hardware-software co-design. We are exploring a new learning frontier where scalability meets sustainability, and we are laying the foundations for provably low-cost, fully erasable machine intelligence.
